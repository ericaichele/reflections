// FIRST REFLECTION
Learning command line and git was on my list for
a while so I am glad that this course was suggested.
I've used the GUIs for GitHub and others with little
real success, so I am glad to know how to do it all
from pretty much any machine via terminal.

// SECOND REFLECTION
Uhhh ok?

// MANUAL COMMITS
Automation is good in several instances, but when its
based on something that is complicated and situational
as a code commit, I would prefer to do it manually. As
someone who saves a lot already, commiting when a
particular hudle is jumped or progress is made that
stands on its own is better than some arbitrary rule.

// MULTI FILE COMMITS
Unless files are tied together in some way, multi file
commits aren't really necessary.

// HOW DO YOU WANT TO USE GIT
Regardless of what I want to use Git for, its the industry
standard VC software so I need to use it. Learning to do all
of this via terminal is pretty great. It also is pushing me
to learn terminal as well which is awesome. Hurray.
