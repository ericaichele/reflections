// What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It sets up the repository so you can start using Git.
If you don't do it, it won't track your changes. It's
kind of a huge step and necessary.

// How is the staging area different from the workng directory and the repository? What value do you think each offers?
This mirrors the development process. The working
directory is where you get the initial files set up
to be processed. The staging area is where you start
working on the items and then you move them onto the
repository so that others can see the work you've
done. It's necessary to have a hierarchy in order
for everything to be organized.
