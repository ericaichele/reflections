// What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It sets up the repository so you can start using Git.
If you don't do it, it won't track your changes. It's
kind of a huge step and necessary.

// How is the staging area different from the workng directory and the repository? What value do you think each offers?
This mirrors the development process. The working
directory is where you get the initial files set up
to be processed. The staging area is where you start
working on the items and then you move them onto the
repository so that others can see the work you've
done. It's necessary to have a hierarchy in order
for everything to be organized.

// How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
It's pretty much that you only add the files that are
associated with the one particular change that you
are trying to commit. If you worked on 4 files and 
only 2 of them are for a particular feature, only
add those two files to the staging area for that
commit.
