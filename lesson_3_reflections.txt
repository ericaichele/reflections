// When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There are three reasons for this:
1. Work collaboratively with a team
2. Backup your work
3. Code Portfolio
4. Share the love

// Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The Git Repo might not have the most recent code and might just
be for public facing versions.

// Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - Used when you want to take someone else's code and adjust it to your tastes.
Clones - Used when you need to either pull a repo from GitHub or when you want to make a whole new version of a project.
Branches - When you write code that will eventually make it back into the main branch of the project.
