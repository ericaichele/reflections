// When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
There are three reasons for this:
1. Work collaboratively with a team
2. Backup your work
3. Code Portfolio
4. Share the love

// Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The Git Repo might not have the most recent code and might just
be for public facing versions.
